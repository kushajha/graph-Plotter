# graph-Plotter
Plots the graph for general conic sections using c++ opengl library and python matplotlib and numpy.

The main program is subdivided into several small programs which are called on mouse click event by the help of system calls.

The program is exclusively developed on Linux platform so Compile time overheads are there in case of compilation in windows environment or mac environment.

The first program is gp.cpp which is linked to graph.cpp and about us.cpp.

graph.cpp is linked with geo.cpp and trigo.cpp.

trigo.cpp is linked to python scripts singr.py cosgr.py tangr.py arcsin.py arccos.py and arctan.py.

geo.cpp is linked to python scripts ellipse.py circle.py hyperbola.py line.py parabola.py and tur.py.

tur.py is a tribute to logo lanuage which emulates two patterns using turtle.
